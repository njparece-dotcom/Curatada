# Vault 1 (formerly Curatada / Quallection)

Personal "vault" for tracking high-end collections — guitars, watches, automobiles,
items of distinction ("iod" / collectibles). Next.js 15 App Router (React 19) +
Postgres + NextAuth (JWT, multi-provider) + Tailwind. Deployed on Railway in
production at [vault1.co](https://vault1.co); local dev runs against a
docker-compose Postgres.

**Note on the rename:** The app was rebranded "Curatada → Vault 1" with the
new production domain `vault1.co`. The codename `Quallection` survives in
the local docker-compose service names, the `package.json` `name` field,
and various internal identifiers (`/spaces/Curatada/...` Confluence URLs,
`cur-web` repo name, `CUR` Jira project key) — those are deferred follow-ups
since they each carry meaningful ripple effects. `lib/mgmt/envelope.ts`
`APP_SLUG = "curatada"` also stays for now; it's the cross-app management
API contract identifier and changing it requires a coordinated update on
the consuming dashboard side.

## Run

### Local dev

```bash
docker compose up -d db        # Postgres on :5432
npm install
npm run dev                    # http://localhost:3000
```

`.env.local` (gitignored) is what `next dev` reads; it should at minimum set
`DATABASE_URL=postgresql://quallection:quallection@localhost:5432/quallection`.
Migrations run automatically the first time Postgres starts (the
`docker-entrypoint-initdb.d` mount in `docker-compose.yml`).

Other commands:
- `npm run db:migrate` — applies new migrations from `db/migrations/*.sql`
  tracked in `schema_migrations` (each file applied once per transaction)
- `npm run build` — production build; mirrors what Railway does
- `node scripts/set-password.js <email> <password>` — admin reset; use via
  `railway run` or with an explicit `DATABASE_URL`

### Production (Railway)

The Dockerfile baked-in CMD is `sh -c "node scripts/migrate.js && exec node server.js"`,
so a deploy runs migrations then exec's the Next server. **Do not set a Custom
Start Command on the Railway service** — it overrides the Dockerfile CMD and
breaks this sequence.

Required env vars on the app service (in addition to platform-injected `PORT`):

| Var | Notes |
|---|---|
| `DATABASE_URL` | Reference variable from the Postgres plugin: `${{Postgres.DATABASE_URL}}` |
| `NEXTAUTH_SECRET` | `openssl rand -base64 32` |
| `NEXTAUTH_URL` | **Public** URL — now `https://vault1.co` (was `https://curatada-production.up.railway.app` pre-rebrand; the old hostname still resolves but the env var should track the canonical brand domain). NextAuth callbacks 500 silently if this is wrong. |
| `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` | For valuations and pursuit search |
| `CRON_SECRET` | Optional; only needed if running a sibling cron service to hit `/api/pursuits/run-search` |
| `MGMT_API_TOKEN` | Bearer token for the cross-app dashboard's `/api/mgmt/v1/*` calls. Without it, the mgmt API returns 503. |
| `MGMT_REQUIRE_INTERNAL` | `1` to reject mgmt calls coming through the public edge (any `x-forwarded-for`). Pairs with `curatada.railway.internal`. |
| `R2_ACCOUNT_ID` / `R2_ACCESS_KEY_ID` / `R2_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY` / `R2_BUCKET` | Cloudflare R2 for image storage. All four required in production; if any is missing the app falls back to local disk. |
| `ADMIN_EMAILS` | Comma-separated allowlist of admin emails. Gates `/admin/moderation` and `/api/admin/*` (see `lib/admin.ts`). Unset = no admins. Match against `session.user.email`, case-insensitive. |
| `NODE_ENV` | Should be `production` (Railway sets this automatically; verify) |

Railway's "Networking → Public Networking → Target Port" must be **3000** (the
Dockerfile EXPOSEs it).

## Architecture

Four collection modules — **guitars, watches, automobiles, collectibles
(items_of_distinction / "iod")**. Originally ~95% copy-paste; Phase 3 of the
refactor (commits a3a580c, c6ebbd8, 114e690, 283ed74) collapsed the shared
machinery into factories. The per-module differences now live in small config
objects.

**Routes**:
- `app/<module>/page.tsx` (list) + `app/<module>/[category]/page.tsx`
- `app/api/<module>/route.ts` and `[id]/route.ts` are thin re-exports of
  `makeListHandlers(<moduleConfig>)` / `makeItemHandlers(<moduleConfig>)` from
  `lib/collection-handler.ts`
- `app/api/<module>/[id]/value/route.ts` re-exports `makeValuationHandler(<config>, <promptBuilder>)`
  from `lib/valuation-handler.ts`
- `app/api/<module>/[id]/valuations/route.ts` — history (user/AI prices)
- `app/api/<module>/import/route.ts` — CSV import
- `app/api/<module>/value-batch/route.ts` (guitars + watches only) — bulk AI valuation
- `app/api/<module>/[id]/images/...` (autos + iod only) — image add/remove
- `app/api/<module>-pursuits/...` — saved searches; cron runs through Claude
  `web_search_20250305` via `lib/pursuit-search.ts`
- `app/api/dashboard/route.ts` aggregates across all four modules
- `app/api/data/export` + `app/api/data/import` — JSON roundtrip
  (items + valuations; image rows skipped until object storage lands)

**Per-module config lives in `lib/collections/`**:
- `<module>.ts` → `CollectionConfig`: table names, FK columns, validation rules,
  field schema, condition rule, force-dynamic flag
- `<module>-prompt.ts` → the per-module Claude prompt for AI valuations

**Auth**: `lib/auth.ts` (NextAuth JWT, multi-provider). Every item table has
`user_id` (migration 012). Every API route MUST check session and filter by
`session.user.id` — the factories do this for you on the routes they own.

**Form shell** (Phase 3c/3d) — Add/Edit modals build on shared primitives:
- `lib/hooks/useImageUpload.ts` + `components/forms/ImagesEditor.tsx` for Add modals
- `lib/hooks/useEditImageList.ts` + `components/forms/EditImagesEditor.tsx` for
  Edit modals (handles existing-vs-new images, toDelete state, drag-reorder)
- `components/forms/ModalShell.tsx` (with `nested` prop for stacked modals) +
  `components/forms/ModalActions.tsx` (with `SaveCheckIcon` export)

## Conventions

- DB access via `query` / `queryOne` from `lib/db.ts` (parameterized only).
- `lib/db.ts` lazy-inits the `pg.Pool` on first call and **caches it on
  globalThis unconditionally** — see Gotchas. SSL is auto-enabled when
  `NODE_ENV === "production"`.
- Image upload: client POSTs to `/api/upload` → gets `{path: "/uploads/<uuid>.ext"}`
  → posts that path with the item create. Storage backend depends on env:
  Cloudflare R2 when `R2_*` vars are set (production), local `public/uploads/`
  on disk otherwise (dev). The DB path format is the same in both —
  `/uploads/<filename>.ext` — and the serve route at `/api/uploads/[...path]`
  resolves it: 302 redirect to a 1-hour presigned R2 URL, or stream from
  disk. R2 client lives in `lib/storage/r2.ts` and is a singleton on
  `globalThis`.
- UI follows `Looks/DESIGN.md` ("Curated Sanctum" — dark, tonal layering, no
  1px borders for sectioning, gold/brass accents). Tailwind tokens in
  `tailwind.config.ts`.
- Module enable/disable is per-user in `user_modules` table, exposed via
  `useUserModules()` from `lib/UserModulesContext.tsx`. Always gate
  module-specific UI with `isEnabled("<module>")`.
- Commits flow through PRs (`gh pr create` + `gh pr merge --squash --delete-branch`).
  Auto-merge is allowed on the repo but has no CI gate yet, so it merges
  immediately when the PR is mergeable. Direct pushes to main are technically
  allowed but discouraged.

## Gotchas

- **`pg.Pool` MUST be cached as a singleton on globalThis in BOTH dev and
  production.** This is non-obvious — most "Next.js + Postgres" patterns
  online only cache in dev (for hot-reload). In production a per-query Pool
  leaks ~10 connections each, and under burst load (e.g. the data importer)
  blows past Railway Postgres's max_connections with `sorry, too many clients
  already`. The current `lib/db.ts` is correct; don't "fix" it by adding the
  dev-only check back.

- **TLS is required for hosted Postgres.** `lib/db.ts` and `scripts/migrate.js`
  both flip `ssl: { rejectUnauthorized: false }` when `NODE_ENV === "production"`.
  Without that, connection errors come back with an empty `.message` and look
  like a mystery — the migration script prints `code`, `severity`, `detail`,
  etc. as a fallback so you can actually see what failed.

- **Migrations are tracked in `schema_migrations`.** Each file applies once,
  in a transaction; new ones don't have to be idempotent. The docker-compose
  `db` service also auto-applies every `.sql` on first start via
  `docker-entrypoint-initdb.d`, so on a fresh local DB the migrate script
  will see all files as already applied. Railway's Postgres plugin does NOT
  do that bootstrap — migrations run on app boot via the Dockerfile CMD.

- **Cron auth is via shared secret.** `/api/pursuits/run-search` accepts
  either a signed-in browser session or `Authorization: Bearer ${CRON_SECRET}`.
  The route is excluded from the NextAuth middleware matcher so the cron
  service can reach it. Both the `app` and any cron service must receive
  the same `CRON_SECRET`. On Railway the cron container from `docker-compose.yml`
  doesn't deploy automatically — set it up as a separate service if needed.

- **Image storage backend is env-driven.** Cloudflare R2 (`lib/storage/r2.ts`)
  in production when all four `R2_*` vars are set; local `public/uploads/` on
  disk otherwise. The DB only stores `/uploads/<filename>.ext` — the serve
  route resolves it. **Image rows from before Phase 4 still reference
  `/uploads/<old-uuid>.ext` but the corresponding R2 object doesn't exist** —
  those will 404 on R2. The Railway container disk also wiped them on each
  pre-Phase-4 redeploy, so they were broken already. Re-upload as needed.
  The export/import flow still skips image *rows* (it predates R2) — that's
  the next thing to wire up now that files actually persist.

- **`claimOrphanedData` in `lib/auth.ts`** assigns every orphan row to the
  first OAuth user that signs in. Disable before opening signups.

- **Image moderation runs in-process at upload time.** `lib/moderation/nsfw.ts`
  loads NSFW.js (MobileNetV2 via `@tensorflow/tfjs`, pure-JS) on first call
  and caches the model on `globalThis` — same singleton pattern as `pg.Pool`.
  `/api/upload` classifies every buffer before writing to storage: scores
  >= 0.95 are hard-rejected (the file never lands in R2/disk and no row is
  inserted); 0.5–0.95 land as `moderation_status='flagged'`; below 0.5 as
  `'clean'`. The verdict is returned in the upload response payload and the
  caller plumbs it into the `*_images` INSERT via `insertImagePaths` in
  `lib/collection-handler.ts`. The classifier fails open (returns `'flagged'`
  with score 0) on model errors so a broken model doesn't block uploads.
  Migration 017 added `moderation_status`, `nsfw_score`, `nsfw_categories`
  to all four image tables; legacy rows default to `'unreviewed'`.

  **Why pure-JS tfjs, not tfjs-node:** `@tensorflow/tfjs-node` ships native
  bindings targeting glibc, and our container is `node:20-alpine` (musl).
  Even with `libc6-compat` the install is fragile. Pure-JS tfjs has no
  native deps and the latency (~500ms–1s per classify on CPU) is fine for
  upload-time checks — the user is already waiting on the R2 PUT anyway.
  We use `sharp` (libvips with prebuilt musl binaries) to decode buffers
  into the 224×224 RGB pixels the model wants.

  **What NSFW.js does NOT catch:** it only classifies sexual content
  (Porn / Sexy / Hentai / Drawing / Neutral). No violence, gore, weapons,
  hate symbols, or other policy categories. A Tier-2 Claude vision pass is
  planned for when an image enters a public gallery — that will revisit
  `flagged` rows and either `approve` or `block` them. The
  `moderation_status` column already includes `'approved'` and `'blocked'`
  values for that pipeline.

  **Admin review queue** lives at `/admin/moderation` and the
  `/api/admin/moderation/*` endpoints. UNION query across all four image
  tables driven by `lib/moderation/queue.ts` `MODULE_TABLES`. Admins
  toggle status chips + drag a min-score slider; approve/block writes
  the new `moderation_status` (no file deletion — reversible by design,
  a future cron sweeps `blocked` R2 objects). Gated by `ADMIN_EMAILS`
  env var; the tab strip is scaffolded for a "Public Gallery review"
  surface that drops in once public galleries exist.

- **Railway build phase has no `DATABASE_URL`.** `lib/db.ts` lazy-inits, so
  importing it doesn't throw during `next build`'s page-data collection.
  Don't reintroduce module-level Pool construction or the build breaks.

- **Next 15: dynamic route `params` is a `Promise`.** Every route handler
  with a `[param]` segment must accept `{ params: Promise<{...}> }` and
  `await params` before reading fields. The factories in
  `lib/collection-handler.ts` / `lib/valuation-handler.ts` already handle
  this — if you add a new dynamic route by hand, follow the same pattern
  (`const { id } = await params;` near the top of the handler). Client
  components using `useParams()` are unaffected — that hook stays sync.

- **React 19 `useRef`** returns `RefObject<T | null>`, not `RefObject<T>`.
  Hook return types that expose a ref need the `| null` (see
  `lib/hooks/useImageUpload.ts` and `lib/hooks/useEditImageList.ts`).

## When adding a feature to "all four modules"

The Phase 3 abstractions cover the list / item-CRUD / valuation routes — a
fifth module costs roughly a config file + a prompt file + 6-line wrappers
for the API routes. Adding a feature on top of the abstractions:

1. If it's a new column on the item table: add a migration, update the
   `CollectionConfig` in `lib/collections/<module>.ts` (the `fields` array),
   and add the input to the Add/Edit modal field JSX.
2. If it's new behaviour on the route: prefer extending the factory in
   `lib/collection-handler.ts` rather than overriding in the route file.
3. If it's UI-only: build on `ModalShell`/`ModalActions`/`ImagesEditor` for
   consistency.

If you find yourself reaching for raw copy-paste again, treat that as a
signal to extend the factory.

## Admin tools

- `scripts/set-password.js` — reset a user's password against any DB:
  ```
  railway run node scripts/set-password.js user@example.com 'pass'
  ```
- `scripts/migrate.js` — manual migration run (already auto-runs on Railway
  deploy via the Dockerfile CMD).

## Management API (cross-app dashboard contract)

This app implements the standard org-wide management API at
`/api/mgmt/v1/*` so a central dashboard can pull metrics. Contract is
identical across every app in the org — see
`~/Downloads/MANAGEMENT_API_PLAYBOOK.md` for the master spec; the bits
specific to this app:

- **App slug**: `curatada` (returned in the envelope's `app` field).
- **Endpoints**: `GET /health`, `GET /summary`, `GET /users` (cursor-paginated
  via `?cursor=&limit=`; default 100, max 500). Implementation in
  `app/api/mgmt/v1/*/route.ts`; shared bits in `lib/mgmt/`.
- **Auth**: `Authorization: Bearer ${MGMT_API_TOKEN}` (constant-time compare
  via `crypto.timingSafeEqual`). If `MGMT_REQUIRE_INTERNAL=1`, requests with
  any `x-forwarded-for` header are rejected as well — pairs with private
  Railway DNS (`curatada.railway.internal`) so public-edge probes can't
  reach the API at all. Without `MGMT_API_TOKEN` set, every endpoint
  returns 503.
- **Rate limit**: 60 req/min per source IP via an in-memory sliding window
  (`lib/mgmt/rateLimit.ts`), singleton on `globalThis`. Single-replica safe;
  swap to Redis if scaled out.
- **`users_active_30d` definition** (app-specific): signed in within 30 days
  AND has at least one item (any of the four collections) added or updated
  within the same 30 days. Defined in the SQL in `lib/mgmt/data.ts` — the
  dashboard does not redefine it client-side.
- **`last_login_at`** is stamped (best-effort, never blocks auth) in
  `lib/auth.ts` for both the Credentials `authorize` path and the OAuth
  `signIn` callback. Migration `015_users_last_login_at.sql` adds the
  column + index.
- **Middleware exclusion**: `/api/mgmt/*` is excluded from the NextAuth
  middleware matcher in `middleware.ts` — the mgmt API has its own auth
  layer and must not be gated by NextAuth.

Smoke test once deployed:

```bash
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer $MGMT_API_TOKEN" \
     https://curatada-production.up.railway.app/api/mgmt/v1/health
```

## Phase status

- **Phase 1** (auth lockdown — `/api/upload`, all `[id]/value`, auto/iod
  pursuits, `value-batch`, `run-search`) — done.
- **Phase 2** (schema_migrations tracker + dedup of 009) — done.
- **Phase 3a/b/c/d** (collection handler factory, valuation handler factory,
  Add modal form shell, Edit modal form shell) — done.
- **Phase 5** (Next 15 + React 19 upgrade) — done (PR #13). Async route
  `params`, `serverComponentsExternalPackages` → `serverExternalPackages`,
  React 19 `useRef` typing all handled.
- **Mgmt API** (`/api/mgmt/v1/*`) — done (PR #12); see the Management API
  section above.
- **Phase 4** (object storage for uploads) — done. Cloudflare R2 via
  `lib/storage/r2.ts` (private bucket + presigned URLs on read).
  `/api/upload` writes to R2 when configured; `/api/uploads/[...path]`
  302-redirects to a 1-hour presigned URL. Local-disk fallback preserved
  for dev. Image rows from before this still 404 (files never persisted
  on the old Railway disk anyway); re-upload as needed. Follow-up:
  add image rows back to the export/import roundtrip.
- **Image moderation Tier-1** (NSFW.js at upload time) — done. Migration
  017 added moderation columns to all four image tables;
  `lib/moderation/nsfw.ts` classifies every upload; `/api/upload`
  hard-rejects at score >= 0.95 and tags 0.5–0.95 as `flagged`. See the
  "Image moderation runs in-process" Gotcha above. **Tier-2 deferred:**
  Claude vision pass on `flagged`/`unreviewed` rows at gallery-publish
  time, gated by the (not-yet-built) public gallery feature.
- **Admin moderation queue** (`/admin/moderation`) — done. Cross-module
  UNION queue with status chips + score slider, approve/block actions.
  Gated by the `ADMIN_EMAILS` env-var allowlist (`lib/admin.ts`). Tab
  strip is scaffolded for the future "Public Gallery review" surface.
- **CI gate for auto-merge** — not done. `gh pr merge --auto` is enabled
  on the repo but with no required status check it merges immediately.
  ~30 lines of GitHub Actions YAML (`tsc --noEmit` + `next build`) plus
  branch protection requiring the check would make `--auto` actually wait.
- **`purchase_date` field on Auto / IoD modals** — DB + API accept it; the
  Add/Edit modal field JSX doesn't expose it. ~80 lines across four files.
- **Disable `claimOrphanedData`** — keep on while you're still bootstrapping
  data; flip off before opening signups.
